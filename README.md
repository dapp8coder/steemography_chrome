This extension is for the Chrome browser

To install, navigate to `chrome://extensions/`, select `Developer Mode` in the upper-right corner, click `Load Temporary Addon`, and select the folder containing the extension.

Once installed, the extension icon will show in the extensions toolbar when you visit any steem blog on steemit.com or steempeak.com (eg. https://steemit.com/@revo)

Click on it to extract images from the user's blog (first 50 posts minus resteems), and they will display in a new tab.
